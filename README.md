# üéÆ CG Spectrum Git Ritual: Leave Your Mark

Welcome to the official CG Spectrum Git Ritual repository ‚Äî a shared space for all programming students across cohorts to leave their mark.

## üß† What Is This?

This is a collaborative GitHub project designed to introduce you to:
- Forking and cloning repositories
- Editing and committing code
- Creating a Pull Request (PR)
- Collaborating in a shared version-controlled space

At the same time, it‚Äôs a chance for you to add something of your own ‚Äî an inspirational quote, thought, or bit of programming wisdom ‚Äî to a file that will grow across terms and students.
